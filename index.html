					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<hr>
					<img src="assets/images/headshot.jpg">
					<p>
					I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida but my family is all from Upstate New York. I have a Bachelors in German from the University of Florida and a Masters in German-English Translation and Localization Project Management from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Califonria. I spent a year and a half living in Germany and also taught English for a year in China.
					</p><br>
					<p>
					I enjoy learning foreign languages (currently improving my Chinese), reading, TV, biking, kayaking, traveling and learning programming languages the best I can. I'm currently teaching myself Python.
					</p><br>
					<p>
					I recently moved to the Denver area to work as Localization Project Manager at a translation/interpreting company in Centennial. I'm hoping to apply the web development skills learned in this course to my current job and transition to a role in Localization Engineering or Website Localization.
